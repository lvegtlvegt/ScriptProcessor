Scene 1 
BETH. Tell me a story, Jo.
JO. Now? Once upon a time, there was a WIZARD named RODRIGO, and he cast a TERRIBLE/ SPELL
BETH. -not that kind of story.
JO. That's what I'm writing, Beth … RODRIGO AND HIS DASTARDLY DEEDS DEPRAVITY! In this chapter, he finds a beautiful, Scantily Clad, SCREAMING maiden, tied up to an ENORMOUS/ worm
BETH. -A REAL one.
JO. Those are boring. Once upon a time, there was a little girl, who was being a pest.
BETH. Her name was Beth.
JO. And this little girl had a monster of a sister-
BETH. Jo!
JO. -that's right, its name was Jo!
BETH. And Beth liked her monster very much. And?
JO. And there were two other sisters in there somewhere. And a mother, and a father. And this family lived in a small house in the shadows of a big city. And outside the city was an even bigger country-
BETH. And that country went to war.
JO. To war with itself. But even though the father went to fight-
BETH. That was hard-
JO. -even if the world had split apart-that little girl and her monster: together, they felt whole.
BETH. What happened when they grew up?
JO. In this story, they never grow up. They just stay the same, and it lasts forever.
BETH. Nothing lasts forever, Jo. Tell it again?
AMY. but I don't WANT to-
BETH. Jo!


Scene 2
AMY. But I don't WANT to, Meg!
MEG. You're too young to turn your hair up, Amy!
HANNAH. MISS AMY, YER NOT WEARING NOTHING BUT BRAIDS, YOU'RE TOO LITTLE!
AMY. I'M NOT LITTLE, HANNAH! I am PRACTICABLY A FULL-GROWN WOMAN! -I'm more of a woman than Jo, anyway! OW!
JO. what?
HANNAH. Yer hands clean at least?
MEG. Ink! Again!
JO. I was writing my play! / I must chase my inspiration in the morning before Aunt March breaks my spirit.
BETH. Where is Marmee, Hannah?
HANNAH. You gonna do something about this?
MEG. What am I supposed to do?
HANNAH. Some creature came begging and your ma went off to see what was needed.
MEG. Why are you wearing the costume, Jo? We're not rehearsing today.
JO. I'm the man of the family, with Father away!
AMY. Josephine is so childish, Meg. It is most aggregating.
MEG. Amy-
JO. "Aggregating"! That's a new one.
MEG. You mean "aggravating;' dear.
JO. "Aggregating:' 
AMY. Ow-
AMY. So what, Jo? A lady should seek to improve her vocabiblary.
JO. Vocabiblary!
AMY. Stop writing them down!
JO. Someday, I shall publish the collection!
AMY. You won't!
JO. Will.
AMY. Won't-Josephine.
JO. Will-!
AMY. WON'T-JOSEPHINE.
HANNAH. GIRLS. EAT. Soldiers are starving in the field!
JO. I have no appetite.
BETH. Poor Jo. It must be hard to wait on Aunt March all day.
JO. Torchewr. But come the new year, she'll take me to EUROPE!
MEG. I'd a thousand times rather sit with Aunt March than be the Mingotts' governess, with Mrs. Mingott-  of the Manhattan Mingotts-always talking down to me.
BETH. Poor Meg.
AMY. At least neither of you have to go to school, the days are quite intermintable-
JO. "Intermintable"!
BETH. Poor Amy-
AMY. -girls laugh at my braids, and sniff because we're poor, and label Papa for being an abolitionist-
JO. "Libel:' Labels are for pickle bottles.
MEG. We all got through school, Amy, and you'll survive it, too.
AMY. OW! Not Beth! Why did she get to stay home?
BETH. Because I am-stupid.
JO. Beth had nervous episodes!
AMY. I'M NERVOUS!
MEG. Amy, hush!
AMY. Why does she get one thing and me another?
MEG. Different people need different things.
JO. And you need to go to school-for you have a terrible case of the Moron!
MEG. JO
JO. -I don't know that it's curable!
AMY. You-YOU'RE THE MORON, YOU STUPID INKY STUPID OLD STUPID JOSEPHINE STUPID! When I grow up I am going to run away with a-a prince, that's all!
JO. "That's all!" 
AMY. And I DON'T need school for that -and I shall NEVER spoil MY hands with working!
JO. My hands are inky because I am going to be a great writer and make my mark upon the world! -and then I'll buy Meg all the dresses she wants and you spelling primers -and Beth, what can I get you, a whole hothouse of flowers?!
BETH. All I want is the family I have, you bad Jo.
AMY. How are you going to become a famous writer? You're just a penniless girl with a nasty temper and a pasted-on mustache. Really, Josephine, you are positively de-lusual!
MEG. . .. "Delusional:'
JO. In a couple of weeks, I'm going to EUROPE! And that's where I'll find the way to make my fortune!
AMY.  Oh, Europe. Europe Europe Europe. Nobody CARES!
JO. You're just jealous.
AMY. Jealous!
JO. You'll see! In Europe, I'll become Shakespeare and Dickens and Thackeray ALL! IN! ONE!
MARMEE. Hello, girls!
BETH. Marmee!
MARMEE. Mustachios, Jo? It's early for the theater. Ouch.
BETH. Where were you?
MARMEE. Do you remember that immigrant woman with the baby, Mrs. Hummel? Her little boy came begging. I went with him and found Mrs. Hummel terribly ill, with her children crying from hunger, in conditions- Well. I tried to help.
BETH. Poor Marmee.
MARMEE. I've been thinking, girls: Christmas is almost here, but it's a hard winter for so many, with the war. Perhaps we shouldn't spend for pleasure. With Father away we can't do much, but we can make some sacrifices. We each can play our part.
MEG. No Christmas?!
MARMEE. We' ll be together, and we'll have Jo's theatrical! But perhaps no presents. You are becoming adults. That means learning what you need and what you don't. It is only a proposal.
AMY. Christmas without any presents!
MEG. Oh, Marmee, it does seem so-
JO. -SAD! Does the war have to take everything?
BETH. They work so hard, Marmee.
JO. Beth does too, she does so much at home
AMY. And me at school-
MEG. Maybe no presents, Marmee. But we each have a dollar! Perhaps we could just ... spend it on ourselves!
JO. Can't we buy just what we really want?
AMY. What we really NEED?
MARMEE. All right, girls. I surrender.
BETH. I'm going to buy YOU something with my dollar, Marmee, a real treat.
MARMEE. I have enough.
HANNAH. Girls! It's Potato O'Clock. Miss Jo.
JO. What?
MARMEE. Jo. You know you can't.
MEG. PREE-SENT!
MARMEE. Marches ... march:
MARCH GIRLS. Glory Glory Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah His Truth is marching on!


Scene 3
AMY. Meg-do you have a dime?
JO. Potato.
AMY. A dime for limes, Meg, I'm dreadfully in debt.
JO. Potato, Amy.
AMY. It's hot!
JO. That's the point.
AMY. I owe a dozen pickled limes to the other girls at school-for if one girl likes another, she gives her a lime, and I've gotten so many but haven't returned any, and soon I shall become a piranha!
JO. Pariah.
MEG. Jo.
JO. Why don't you spend your Christmas dollar on limes?
AMY. I shall be using my dollar to buy a muff, Josephine-so I never shall have to carry a dirty hot potato ever again! Besides, that money is to buy something for ourselves, not for others!
MEG. -I know we ought to give up presents gladly, but I'm just not that good.
JO. We ought to do many things-
MEG. -we ought to be grateful! After all, we have Father and Marmee and each other.
AMY.  We haven't got Father and won't for a long time. Perhaps- or- perhaps never.
JO. Don't say that!
AMY. And my dollar can't bring him back, can it! So I'm getting myself a muff!
MEG. Amy-
JO. What's that?
MEG. Hannah said Mr. Laurence's grandson moved in next door. His parents died.
JO. He sure can play.
AMY. It's sad.
JO. An orphan, growing up alone in that big house-you’d be sad, too.
MEG. He has a tutor, Hannah said, and his grandfather.
JO. You can be lonely in a crowd, if it's not the right crowd.
AMY. Don't, Jo-it's so boyish. Meg, my dime? My dime, Meg? My dime?
JO. POTATO!
AMY. Limes! Limes! Limeslimeslimeslimes-
JO. You never would have given me a dime, in our school days.
MEG. Don't be jealous.
JO. Me-jealous of Amy?!
MEG. Time for work, Josephine. Jo!








Scene 4
LAURIE. Oh! Hello! Are you all right? I say, miss, are you all right?
AMY. Leave me alone! LEAVE ME ALONE TO DIE IN THE SNOWWWWWW!
LAURIE. -Come, what's the matter?
AMY. -I can't say, it's too shameful!
LAURIE. Well-sure. A damsel in distress should retain an air of mystery. You're one of the March girls, aren't you? I've been watching-seeing you all. I'm Theodore Laurence. But my friends call me Laurie.
AMY. Laurie Laurence? That's terrible. Why not Theodore?
LAURIE. It's just not who I am. Don't you want to go indoors?
AMY. Nobody understands me in there.
LAURIE. Truly? You all seem so happy together. I mean, when I happen to-to see you.
AMY. They tease and scold me and think I'm spoilt! NO no-nobody even TRIES to understand me ANY WHERE!
LAURIE. -I'm trying.
AMY. Well-I owed a dozen pickled limes to the other girls at school, you see-
LAURIE. Of course-
AMY. -for if one girl likes another, she gives her a lime, and I was becoming a piranha-
LAURIE. Naturally-
AMY. And-and Mr. Smith caught me passing a lime-
LAURIE. The scoundrel-
AMY. -and he brought me to the front of the room and he took a rod and he-he WHACKED me!
LAURIE. Shall I kill him for you?
AMY. Yes please. It's all red and hot.
LAURIE. -better?
BROOKS. Theodore Laurence, you cannot escape your lessons forever!-Oh What is-that?
LAURIE. It's the neighbors' little girl, Brooks.
BROOKS. -Hello, uh-Neighbor's Little Girl./ Have you-hurt, or
AMY. I am NOT a little girl, I'm NOT
BROOKS. All right-Just bring her to her parents-
AMY. -I AM A FULL-GROWN WOMAN!
BROOKS. Theodore, you have Latin!!!!
MEG. Yes? Can I help you?
LAURIE. -I, uh, found a damsel in distress upon your snowbank..
MEG. Amy, what are you doing here?!!!!
JO. Christopher Columbus, why aren't you in school?!!
MEG. Please excuse us, Mr.-
AMY. I want to talk to Marmee
MEG. Mr.-?
AMY. I WANT TO TALK TO Marmee!
MEG. Please excuse us!
BROOKS. Brooks. John Brooks.
LAURIE. She may need this.
JO. If she's the damsel in distress, you must be the knight in shining armor?
BROOKS. Theodore! ... Latin. LATIN!
MEG. Jo!


Scene 5
MARMEE. There's enough violence in the country without men hitting little girls.
AMY. I'm not a little girl!
MARMEE. You can take leave from school for now, Amy-
AMY. Huzzah!
MARMEE. -and be tutored by me at home, instead.
AMY. Oh.
MARMEE. "Oh:' And no limes in my classroom.
MEG. Let's wash your face.
JO. Marmee, we all had to survive school-why shouldn't she?
MARMEE. You liked school.
BETH. I got to stay home, Jo.
JO. Yes, Beth, but you're-you're my conscience, is what you are, and Amy is terribly spoilt. What kind of lesson will she learn?
MARMEE. -Look at Beth's flowers, will you?
JO. Marmee, please-no analogies.
MARMEE. Here's a violet: How do we care for it, Beth?
BETH. They like things calm-not too hot or cold. And they like the shade of other plants, so we pot them.with their relations.
MARMEE. And here's a rose: What does it need?
BETH. You have to put it where the sun is! And it's delicate; you have to give it support, or it won't thrive.
JO. Ow.
BETH. -thorns.
MARMEE. The rose would wilt if she gave it the care of another flower, and the violet too. One isn't better than the other. They just need different things to grow.
JO. So if Beth is a violet-
BETH. Oh!
JO. And Amy a rose-what is Meg?
BETH. A-Daisy! She bloomed before all the others!
JO. Then I am ... Moss. Dirt. A rock.
MARMEE. You are-whatever you're supposed to be. Look at them: Aren't they beautiful together?
MEG. The wound is salved-with Mr. Laurence's hankie, no less.
AMY. His NAME is LAURIE.
JO. Laurie Laurence? That's terrible.
MARMEE. I want to hear all about him, and about the rest of your days-so wash up for dinner.
MEG. Speaking of my day, Jo-the Mingotts invited us to their dance this weekend.
JO. Oh no. No nonono-
MEG. You MUST come with me, Jo-
AMY. I will, I will-
MEG. You're too little, Amy!
JO. Meg- No, no no-I work all the time and I want to have an evening In
AMY. ERNGH!!!!
MEG. Jo, I work all the time and I want to have an evening out-and you know I can't go unchaperoned- And we're growing up now, and that means we must appear in society! I want it-I NEED it so much! PLEASE?!!!
JO. -But I'm the rock.


Scene 6
MEG. Do I look all right?
JO. Don't ask me for womanish opinions, Meg, I never say the right thing.
MEG. Just keep it simple, as: "Oh, Jo, your hair looks so well:'
JO. Oh, Meg, I-like-your ... dress.
MEG. Marmee says I may have a silk when I am married-but I'll be so old by the time that happens!
JO. I should hope so. -What?
MEG. Why are you holding your pop' like that?
JO. There's a rip in the seat.
MEG. Can't you hold your gloves over it?
JO. I spilled lemonade on 'em.
MEG. And WHAT is THIS?
JO. A burn. I think.
MEG. Jo, just-stand against the wall, so nobody sees you. But don't put your hands behind you. Or say '.'Christopher Columbus:' Or stare, or bounce, or breathe-
JO. MEG! Tell you what: if you see me doing anything wrong, give me a poke.
MEG. Poking isn't ladylike. I'll give a cough! Like this-
JO. -really?
MEG. -here comes Mrs. Mingott! Jo--just stand there normally- NOT normally! NOT NORMALLY, JO. APPROPRIATELY.
MRS. MIN GOTT. Miss Josephine! And dear Miss March! -are you all right?
MEG. Oh! Yes.
MRS. MINGOTT. The governess at the ball! And my heavens, don't you look. .. smart.
MEG. Thank you?
MRS. MINGOTT. Cinderella before the godmother! Well, poof here I am: I'll make a princess yet. Oop,there, there, no- -and put THESE, just-so- Alakazam.
MEG. Oh!
MRS. MINGOTT. Now stay right there. STAY!
JO. Meg, you can't see without your glasses!
MEG. I can so!
JO. How many fingers am I holding up?
MEG. Don't be ridiculous!
JO. You're blind!!! Half-naked and blind.
MEG. Don't talk to me like I'm Amy, Josephine, I am your elder, and what's more, I am ACTING like a LADY! Ow..
MRS. MINGOTT. Miss March, Miss Marrrrch! Look, Cinderella I have conjured up a wobbly old Prince!
JO. It's Mr. Brooks, Meg.
MEG. Who?
JO. The Laurence boy's tutor.
MRS. MINGOTT. As Miss March is our governess, you two should have PLENTY to talk about- lesson plans, trigonometry, and- and chalk. I insist that you fearsome scholars take a turn about the room, now! Oop!
BROOKS. Madame.
MRS. MINGOTT. And Miss Josephine! Hm hm hm HM. I'll dig up some creature for you, somehow-some way. You stay right there! STAY!
JO. Ohl-please excuse me!
LAURIE. No! Stay.-and I'll go.
JO. -if l disturbed you, I'm sorry-
LAURIE. I only ducked in here to-to. You know.
JO. Escape?
LAURIE. A fellow refugee, then.
JO. Don't go away. - Unless you’d rather.
LAURIE. I think I've had the pleasure of seeing you before, madame.
JO. I believe you live next door. "Sirrah."
LAURIE. Funny how stiff one gets in these situations. Drag me to a social and I'm a cat on a leash.
JO. Dead cat on a leash.
LAURIE. How is your little sister, Miss March?
JO. She's fine, Mr. Laurence. But I'm not "Miss March:' -I'm Jo.
LAURIE. I'm not Mr. Laurence. I'm Laurie.
JO. Laurie Laurence. That's terr .. .ific.
LAURIE. My real name is Theodore, but the boys called me Dora, so I thrashed 'em into saying Laurie instead. 
JO. Really?
LAURIE. -No. I've never, um, thrashed anybody. Yet.
JO. Tell you a secret? -I hate Josephine too. Do sit?
LAURIE. Thanks awfully. These pumps hurt like the devil.
JO. These boots are dainty little tortures-but as Aunt March says, Let Us Be Elegant Or Die.
LAURIE. .. .who's Aunt March?
JO. I'm a businessman-lady, I mean, so I wait on my great-aunt for wages, and she's a nasty old cat. But she's taking me to Europe in the new year! Wouldn't bring me along 'til I could pay for my own board, but I've finally saved up enough to go. And who knows what I can become in Europe?
LAURIE. . . .I know something about doing the bidding of cross old people.
JO. D'you work?
LAURIE. No, I get tutored. My grandfather has great plans for me, and bought me out of the draft. I am someday to be a tedious titan of industry! So I must grind away 'til college, where I will learn how to do what I don't wish to do, in order that I may do MORE of what I don't like in the future.
JO. Lucky!
LAURIE. What?
JO. -lucky to go to college! How can you complain of that? -I'm sorry, I'm being-I'm so awkward, I always talk too openly. If Meg was here she'd cough herself into a fit over me being boyish.
LAURIE. No, I. .. I like it.
JO. I'm not very good at being a, you know, a "ladY:'
LAURIE. I'm not very good at being a "gentleman:' So perhaps we should-be ourselves.
JO. Do you mind if l take these boots off? They're killing me.
LAURIE. -May I do the same?
JO. Christopher Columbus. Look at them, side by side!
LAURIE. I'd rather be a girl than a boy.
JO. You wouldn't!
LAURIE. Then I wouldn't have to do all the things that m en are supposed to: waste away life in billiards and business, march off to war, be as unfeeling as granite! If I were a lady, I'd compose on the piano all day, and nobody would bother me.
JO. Nobody would bother you except to tell you to wash the dishes, or tend the children, or catch a man before you become an old maid. At least your grandfather has plans for you! I'd like to be a-a great writer, or a famous actor, or a soldier alongside my father, but I'm scarcely let out of the house without being told what a disgrace I am! If I were a boy, people would care more about what I could do than what I should do, and I'd be thought a tremendous talent instead of a-a big ugly stone in the flower garden.
LAURIE. Not ugly at all. I mean. I like your-gloves. They're spandy.
JO. "Spandy"!
LAURIE. What's that?
JO. My notebook-I always carry it with me, to write down words for my great novel someday! "SpandY:' An outfit is made by gloves, that's what Marmee says.
LAURIE. Marmee?
JO. We say it instead of Mother-you must think that childish.
LAURIE. Not at all. Your ah, Marmee? I watch her, in your parlor. That is. Sometimes when you forget to draw the curtain, I can see you all together. I haven't got a mother, you know. Anymore. So.
JO .... That polka is gay, isn't it?
LAURIE. Do you like to dance?
JO. No. Well, yes-but I'm sure to break something or step on somebody's toes. Or step on something, or break somebody's toes.
LAURIE. I'm hardy enough.
JO. Oh-I'm such an awkward old fellow, honestly.
LAURIE. Come on. Jo. What are you: afraid?
JO. YOU should be afraid -Laurie.
LAURIE. No, no-you lead!
JO. Oh! Meg-I-
LAURIE. Brooks-we were just- 
BROOKS. Theodore! WHERE are your SHOES?
MEG. -Jo, I can't see ANYTHING, there was a blur and then po went my ankle- 
JO. I have your glasses, do you want them?
MEG. With the gentlemen looking?
JO. Can you walk home?
MEG. -we can't afford a carriage. 
LAURIE. Miss March, I can't bear a damsel in distress. You must take our coach! Bully! I'll just bring our man around.
MEG. Give the Mingotts our regrets, Jo-
JO. "Bully"!
MEG. IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER (COUGH COUGH COUGH.) 
LAURIE. Ow!
JO. Race!
BROOKS. Miss March, I must have given you a wrong turn in the dance, its my leg-
MEG. No, no, I got myself into this. I was being childish-and silly and too vain about my looks and now everybody's evening is ruined.
BROOKS. -nobody's evening was ruined-
MEG. Pardon me-
BROOKS. And I don't think you ever could be too vain-  About your looks.
MEG. Oh!
LAURIE. Cinderella, your carriage awaits. oh.
JO. Oh.
MRS. MINGOTT. Miss Josephine! Miss Josephine! I've dug somebody
up!


Scene 7


JO. You shall yet be my bride My spells will hold and bind you Captive at my side!
MEG. O sad, my heart! 0 mad, my part! 0, what end of a maiden's art! Jo, I have some questions about this rhyme scheme.
JO. Keep going!
MEG. I loved you once, Rodrigo But those days are no more l can't go back to being Who I was before! All things change, Rodrigo Whatever spell you say! You can't turn me to stone And you can't make me stay-
JO. I can make whatever thing That I wish come true!I am ALL-POWERFUL! I'll show the world-show you! I'll just take you back in time I'll turn back that clock! Back to those better days Time itself I mock! I won't accept this change Not now, and not ever- I'll make you stay the same And I'll make it last forever! MWA ha HA HA HA HA! MwA ha Ha ha Ha!
BETH. Meg: "Lucella screams thrillingly:'
AMY. -0 SWEET RUBELLA!
THE OTHERS. LUCELLA!
AMY. This beard keeps falling off.
JO. Back!
BETH. "Lucella screams thrillingly:'
AMY. 0 SWEET LUCELLA! Line!
BETH. "It is I-"
AMY. It is I, brave Valentino, a Wandering Knight of Some Renown! Sword, to her dalliance-
THE OTHERs. DELIVERANCE!
AMY .... Line!
BETH. Sword to her-
AMY. Eek! Deliverance-
JO. Stop, stop-
AMY. Speed to the breast of my manly foe-!
JO. STOP! This isn't working.
AMY. Of course it's not working, you won't let me get my lines out!
JO. The problem here is that Amy is not a convincing gentleman-  And if it's not realistic, why should we care?
MEG. This is a play about a wizard.
JO. But without any truth, it's dry and stakeless.
MEG. Perhaps I could play the gentleman, and Amy Lucella!
AMY. Ooh-
JO. Amy's too little.
AMY. (Pure rage.) OOH!
JO. I regret to inform you, Amy, that you are dismissed.
AMY. "Dismissed"?
JO. You can't help who you are, dear. But I shall give you a nonspeaking role: a fairy, or a servant/ or-
AMY. Servant!
JO. a woodland creature!
AMY. You cannot dismiss me-because I QUIT! This role is STUPID and this play is STUPIDER-it's for CHRISTMAS but it doesn't have anything to DO with that, no angels or nativity or Saint Nick or ANYTHING-
JO. Seasonal pageants are BORING, Amy, I am TRYING to do something ORIGINAL!
AMY. and YOU, stupid old Josephine, are absolutely-AUTOMATIC!
MEG. . .. autocratic.
AMY. RRAAARNNNGGGH!
JO. There are no small roles, Amy, only small actors!
MEG. Jo, this is supposed to be fun.
BETH. Maybe-maybe it's hard for Amy because, she, she's pretending to be someone who's so different from herself. Maybe if this play were about-real stories, about girls like us-
JO. -those stories are even more boring than seasonal pageants. No, no, the play is perfect-
MEG. Ahrm-
JO. I just need to rethink casting.
MEG. You don't mean to put Beth in?
BETH. No-!
JO. I don't want anybody in the wrong role. I shall just SPIRIT UP an errant knight, a wand'ring gentleman- somewhere, SOMEHOW …  hmm hummena-humeena, HUMEENA HUMMENA SHAKALAKA ZAM!
MEG. Mr. Laurence!
JO. The Brave Valentino! EN GARDE!
LAURIE. EN GARDE!
MEG. JO! May I speak to you for a moment?
JO. Hold, Valentino-the diva wishes an aside!
MEG. We don't want boys here, Jo! He'll make fun of us!
JO. Laurie isn't like that, Meg! We've become such friends in the last week. l And he knows loads about sword fighting and mustachios and wonderful man things that I, for one, want to know.
MEG. This is a ladies' club!
LAURIE. A few of these keys are broken, aren't they? I tinker around with my own piano a bit, perhaps I could fix them?
JO. -See?!! Gentle as any girl! And he's lonely in that big house, with nobody to talk to but his mean old grandfather and that stuffy tutor Brooks.
MEG. Mr. Brooks isn't stuffy.
JO. Please, Meg, please? I want it-I need it, so much.
MEG. Mr. Laurence. Welcome to our comp'ny.
JO. Beth, strike up a victory march!
LAURIE. I'll find a way to fix those keys- 
AMY. You MUST allow me to do Valentino, I've finally got it to stick-oh. My. God.
LAURIE. The damsel! 
JO. Play, Beth! PLAY! 
HANNAH. Ladies-
JO. EN GARDE!
LAURIE. EN GARDE!
HANNAH. LADIES! A Gentleman's Come Calling.
LAURIE. Grandfather!
MR. LAURENCE. -Brooks tells me that you've been neglecting your studies, Theodore.
LAURIE. I-
MR. LAURENCE. You have a part to play, sir. And not amongst the women.
LAURIE. Grandfather-
MR. LAURENCE. We are too old for these games! Come!
JO. No-!
MEG.  Jo!
JO. You can't keep him locked away, like an ogre! He's a growing boy, he needs company and amusement, and-and sunlight in which to bloom!
MEG. My God, Jo, what are you saying?
MR. LAURENCE. He doesn't need your rescue, madam, he's not some damsel in distress.
JO. He's a gentleman in distress! And without him, our play is a disaster. Please?!!! Christopher Columbus.
MEG. Jo, you shouldn't have interfered.
JO. I can't abide seeing a body stuffed into the wrong role. .
HANNAH. Oh, I don't know, Miss Meg-it's good to make friends
with that boy. He may take a shine to one of you.
MEG. Hannah!
HANNAH. Ho-ho!
JO. This is all that abominable Brooks' fault, for tattling!
MEG. He isn't abominable!
JO. What?
MEG. YOU'RE abominable!
JO. What??! Actresses. Why are you all dressed up?
AMY. Where is Laurie?
JO. Gone.
AMY. This is all your fault, Josephine! You have RUINED my day, and Meg's day, and-and CHRISTMAS!




Scene 8
MR. LAURENCE. Enter. ENTER! Madame.
BETH. Mr. Laurence-
MR. LAURENCE. I can't hear you, madame-
BETH. Mr. Laurence, sir I came to ask you-
MR. LAURENCE. Speak up-
BETH. Mr. Laurence, sir I came to ask you-if you won't let, please, your grandson do our-our theatrical.
MR. LAURENCE. Why do you girls all think Theodore needs rescuing? Am I-as your sister said, an ogre?
BETH. N-no, sir. Lonely.
MR. LAURENCE. Me!
BETH. Laurie, sir. And he was kind about my piano, and looked so happy when Meg said he might join our comp'ny. And if not-our our play is a disaster, said Jo, and Amy said our-our Christmas is-ruined.
MR. LAURENCE. What is your name?
BETH. B-Beth.
MR. LAURENCE. You must think me the villain from Mr. Dickens' book, Beth March, to ruin Christmas.
BETH. I- I think people don't always see exactly what they do, sir.
MR. LAURENCE. I imagine you see. I had a little girl once, with eyes like yours. You like that piano? That belonged to her. Theodore's mother.
BETH. What happened to her?
MR. LAURENCE. She grew up. Run back to your mother!


Scene9
MEG. 0 sad, my part! 0 mad, my heart! 0, what end of a maiden's art!
JO. OTHER WAY. "O sad, my HEART! 0 mad, my PART!"
MEG. No notes, Jo! You're lucky we came back at all!
AMY. YES, NO notes, Josephine, you promised!
MEG. "O sad, my HEART! 0 mad my PART-" 
LAURIE."O WHAT ENNNNNNNND TO A MAIDEN'S ARRRRRRRT???!!!" 
JO. Brave Valentino! 
LAURIE. The foul Rodrigo!
MEG. What are you doing here?
LAURIE.  It's a holiday miracle, Lucella! May I rejoin your comp'ny?
MEG. No-
JO. MEG!
MEG. No, Laurie, not if it upsets your grandfather!
LAURIE. It's blessed by the old man himself! He had a visitation of the conscience.
JO. Beth?
AMY. She couldn't have! She's-she's-Beth!
JO. What-what can I ever do for her? nWhat can I-anything! Christmas! What does she want for Christmas?
AMY. What is she buying herself with her dollar?
MEG. She's buying something for Marmee.
JO. I never felt !ike ~such a selfish child. I'll do the same: I'll buy Marmee something, instead of a gift for myself.
MEG. Me too.
AMY. . . . . . All right! I will, too.
MEG. That's all that Beth wants , I'm sure.
LAURIE. we can do better than that.


Scene 10
JO. Three ... two ...
ALL GIRLS. MERRY CHRISTMAS!
MEG. -It's all for you, Marmee!
JO. Army shoes, best to be had!
BETH. Handkerchiefs-
JO. Beth did the embroidery!
AMY. And cologne, that's from me!
MARMEE. Girls-how?
AMY. We all spent our dollars!
MARMEE. You shouldn't have.
MEG. We had a visitation of the conscience.
MARMEE. What about your gifts?
BETH. -we have enough.
MARMEE. You're all growing up so fast. 
BETH. Look at the flowers, Marmee-and we hung up mistletoe, you see 
JO. Beth. What is that over there?
BETH. What?
MEG. In the corner.
JO. Maybe Saint Nicholas came.
AMY. Yes, it must have been SaintNicholas!
JO. Go and look.
MEG, AMY, and JO. MERRY CHRISTMAS!
JO. Good strong oak-no broken keys here
MEG. See the brackets, to hold candles
AMY. And look, real silk-
MARMEE. Girls-how?
JO. Not us, Marmee-
MEG. Look at the card.
MARMEE. "To the ghost of Christmas Past-from Mr. Scrooge:' Beth?
JO. Beth! 
MEG. - Beth!
AMY. She's running to the Laurences!
MARMEE. Fetch her coat, she'll catch her death-
AMY. Oh, she’s coming out again. 
MEG. She can’t handle so much excitement. 
MEG. Here they come!!!
AMY. -here they ALL come!
JO. Hurrah, Huzzah, Hail the conquering heroes!
LAURIE. EN GARDE!
JO. EN GARDE!
LAURIE. Mrs. March-pardon me, I-
MARMEE. Call me Marmee.


Scene 11
MARMEE. Beth, you'll wear yourself out. I think she'll never stop. 
BETH. I wish I never had to.
JO. Your fingers are going to fall off! 
BROOKS. Miss March. Merry Christmas.
MEG. Oh. Um. Merry Chr-
BROOKS. Would you-would you like to dance?
JO. Oh my God.
MEG .... Now?
BROOKS. There's music.
JO. CHRISTMAS music, Brooks.
BROOKS. (Still holding his hand out to Meg.) Ia. like to try again.
JO. Oh my God!
BROOKS. -I'm sorry, you're-it's-I'll (go)
MEG. No! I mean yes. Yes. Let's.
JO. Oh my God.
AMY. D'AWWWW!
MARMEE. Amy! Hush.
LAURIE. You see that?
JO. No, Laurie, I went blind for the holidays.
LAURIE. It's romantic!
JO. It's disgusting!
LAURIE. Do you have such a low opinion of matrimony?
JO. Matrimony?! This is one dance. One incredibly awkward dance.
LAURIE. That's how it starts ...
JO. Meg is too young to be thinking about marriage.
LAURIE. We all grow up, eventually ...
JO. Stop! How could Meg want-that?
LAURIE. D n e d. 
BROOKS. Desgustibus non est desputadum.
LAURIE. -whatever Brooks said- taste is not disputable.
JO. He would lecture in a dead language. Stuffy old Brooks!
LAURIE. What do you want, old fellow? For Christmas.
JO. Boot lacings.
LAURIE. Be serious. What do you really want, Jo, more than anything? I'll buy it for you.
JO. Genius. Don't you wish you could buy it, Laurie?
LAURIE. I wish a great many things. Well?
JO. Well what?
LAURIE. I thought you liked to dance?
JO. Not like that.
LAURIE. -we can take off our shoes-.
AMY. I'll dance with you, Laurie!
LAURIE. I'll get you yet, Jo... 
MARMEE. Who could that be?
AMY. Do we have to get it RIGHT NOW?
LAURIE. Perhaps it's Saint Nicholas!
AMY. BETH, KEEP PLAYING. Laurie?!!!!!
MESSENGER. Is this the March household?
MARMEE. It is.
MESSENGER. Telegram.
MARMEE. Merry Christmas!
JO. Marmee?
MARMEE. "Mrs. March: Your husband is gravely wounded. Come at once. Harewood Hospital, Washington."
AMY. but it's-it's Christmas.
MR. LAURENCE. We'll get you a ticket to Washington, Mrs. March next train out.
LAURIE. I'll run to the station now
MARMEE. Oh-but. it's Christmas, you (must have)-
LAURIE. So let me give you something-Marmee.
BROOKS. Mrs. March! Let me go with you.
MARMEE. Oh, no-
BROOKS. A lady shouldn't be down there unescorted. Let me do my duty.
MARMEE. Jo-I'll need what we have in the kitty.
AMY. If we empty the kitty, how will we pay the rent?
MARMEE. Shh, Amy, I don't know. Jo? I'm going to need ... all of it. I don't think you can go to Europe, dearest. Not this year. Jo?
MEG. Jo! 
AMY. But-we've been good and worked so hard, and gave up presents-and now we can't have the theatrical or do anything and-it's not fair.
MARMEE. I know.
MEG. Mr. Brooks.-! hope that-  our father will be better soon, and you-
BROOKS. Miss March, please don't cry.
MEG. -and you may be back about your business quickly- I’m sorry- 
BROOKS. I mean-you may cry, if you like, I just-
MEG. It's just, my papa-
BROOKS. I would do anything. To help you. You do know that, Miss March? 
MEG. Call me Meg.
MARMEE. Come round me, girls. Where is Jo-
JO. HEEERE I AMMMMM! And here's to bringing Father home!
MARMEE. You haven't done anything rash?
JO. I only sold what was my own.
AMY. Jo! Your one beauty!
JO. I was wild thinking of Father, and us not being able to make the rent, or, or-do anything-and you always say we each can play our part-and I thought of the wigmaker's shop, and how I always see tails of hair there. And so I ran down the street and pounded on the wigmaker's door and burst into his Christmas and scared his wife half to death, but their son is in the army so once I blubbered it all out.she made him give me a good price- twenty-five, see?!!! I never felt a thing, just a big weight off my shoulders- And I saved a lock for you, so you could lay it away, as you did when we were children. I bet it's the last girl's lock you'll ever have from any of us-from, from me. Marmee-aren't you pleased?
MARMEE. My little women.  Marches, March!
MARCH GIRLS. Sisters sisters will you join us! Sisters sisters will you join us! Sisters sisters will you join us! For the Union keeps us strong!




Scene 12
AMY. It feels as if there's been an earthshake.
JO. "Earthshake"!
MEG. Earthquake, Amy.
AMY. Don't write that down, Josephine. Don't you dare write that down! JOSEPHINE!
MEG. Amy, don't shout, it isn't ladylike!
AMY. Tell her not to write!
JO. Tell her not to put on airs! 
BETH. My head hurts.
HANNAH. (From the kitchen.) Girls, STOP YELLING! YELLING IS NOT FOR LADIES!
GIRLS. YES HANNAH 
HANNAH. And if you don't clean up that mess, I'll give all your things to the street Irish, I swear I will!
GIRLS. YES HANNAH!
JO. We really ought to pull these decorations down. 
BETH. I can't, for I'm going to visit the poor   Hummel children~the baby's been sick. You or Meg ought to go with me, Jo- I don t know what to do for her.
MEG. I can't today, Beth-I have to write to Marmee.
AMY. And to Brooooooooks-
MEG. Don't be impertinent, Amy-
JO. Don't be RIDICULOUS, Amy-
MEG. AND I have to dictate the week's menu to Hannah, for I'm mistress of the house now, you know.
HANNAH. OH REALLY, MISS MEG? YOU OUGHT TO LEARN TO COOK YOURSELF, HEAVEN KNOWS YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH
JO. "Mistress of the house:'
HANNAH. "DICTATE THE MENU" MY LEFT FOOT 
BETH. Jo?
JO. I can't today-I have business.
AMY. What business? Plans with Laurie! He was whispering to you yesterday. I know you're plotting something!
JO. Eavesdropping is very Unladylike.
BETH. Will you come with me to the Hummels, Amy?
AMY. I cannot go to see the dirty little Hummels, Elizabeth! For I have business of my own! Big, IMPORTANT business!
LAURIE.  Hallo! ... Why all the long faces??
JO. Hsst, Valentino! The WALLS have EARS.
LAURIE. Ow!
JO. Race!
HANNAH.  MISS MEG! TIME TO GET THOSE FINE HANDS DIRTY!
BETH. Amy-
AMY. I. Have. Business.


Scene 13
LAURIE. Jo March, published author! Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzz-
JO. -One teeny-tiny story, in one little newspaper. But my first check as a writer- thirty whole dollars, can you believe it?
LAURIE. He ought to have paid more!
JO. You drove a hard bargain. He didn't want to give even that. 
LAURIE. This is the first of many!
JO. Do you really think so?
LAURIE. You'll be the talk of the Union-of the whole planet!
JO. -I do want to be, Laurie! That's what I wish more than anything! I don't want to just, you know, write sentimental little ladies stories. I don't want to have a small, well-behaved life! I want to be one of the greats, and shake the world, and outlive my time. . . .that must sound so childish. 
LAURIE. I want you to get ... everything, Jo. Everything you’ve ever wanted. 
JO. I can't thank you enough, Laurie, for having the idea to do this.
LAURIE. I had to make up for you missing out on Europe, didn't I?
JO. With wages like this- I'll get there soon!
LAURIE. We make a good team, pulling together.
JO. A mismatched team! I don't think that publisher believed you were my agent. You ought to have said you were my brother.
LAURIE. Your brother! ... No. Ow!
JO. Hallooooo?! Beth?
BETH. -The Hummel baby died, Jo. I was holding her, and I looked down, and.. I thought maybe if I prayed, or sang to her, or pretended it didn't happen, it wouldn't be true-but I was being- childish, to think I could make it better by wishing. Laurie, have you had scarlet fever? Jo did, before I was born.
LAURIE. When I was seven-
JO. Scarlet fever?
BETH. The other Hummels have sore throats. And my head hurts. 
AMY. Aha! I'VE CAUGHT you BOTH!
BETH. Amy's never had it.
AMY. The GIG, I tell you, is UP!
JO. Amy, you have to go.
AMY. What?!!
JO. Laurie.


Scene 14
AMY. Please don't send me away!
HANNAH. She'll be better in a day or two. But we'll send for the doctor, just in case. 
MEG. Should we write to Marmee?
HANNAH. And frighten the poor woman? Don't you dare. I wouldn't write to her unless it were very bad. Miss Beth will be better when the week is through. Better by next week, I'm sure. . .
JO. Laurie! You're still here.
LAURIE. Of course. Please let me do something for you, Jo. You know I can't abide a
damsel in distress. 
JO. Laurie- Race.




Scene 15
HANNAH. Took care of all of you since you were babies. Each one of you growing different than the other. Miss Beth was always so delicate.
JO. She'll be better soon, won't she?
MEG. Hannah?-should we write to Marmee?
HANNAH. No. I'll do it myself
AMY. Please don't scold me.
JO. Amy, you're supposed to be at Aunt March's.
AMY. I ran away. Please don't make me go!
MEG. Beth isn't infectious anymore.
JO. She's too young!
MEG. We're all too young for this.
JO. Beth!
MEG. We're here
AMY. All of us.
BETH. Jo-tell me a story.
JO. Now?
BETH. A real one.
JO. Once upon a time, there was a family. A father, a mother and four girls. But the best of them all, the conscience of the family-her name was Beth.
BETH. And when that girl died ...
JO. In this story, Beth, the girl never dies. She stayed with that family. And together, they were whole.
MEG. And together, they were safe.
AMY. And together they lived happily ever after.
JO. They lived… Beth?


Scene 16
AMY. Laurie! Meg, Jo! Where have you been? 
JO. Laurie-!
MEG. Marmee-!
JO. The fever broke, Marmee! Beth is so much better!
MARMEE. Merry Christmas, girls. We have brought you-a very late present.
AMY. Papa!!!!
HANNAH. MR. MARCH! Mrs. March! How fast can those newfangled telegrams go, I just wrote to you this morning-!
MARMEE. Laurie fetched us yesterday, Hannah.
HANNAH. Mr. Theodore, I ought to have you whipped OH MR. MARCH TO HAVE YOU HOME AGAIN!
JO. Old fellow, how can I ever thank you?
MEG. Mr. Brooks- how can I ever thank you?
BROOKS. -call me John.
JO. Laurie-do something!-Mr. Brooks is behaving dreadfully, and Meg likes it!
LAURIE. You haven't taken any of the decorations down yet?
JO. What shall we do?
LAURIE. Jo! Look!
MARMEE. Shh, Amy, SHH!
HANNAH. Don't wake-



ACT TWO

ACT
Scene 1


JO. I can make whatever thing that I wish come true. I am All-powerful! I'll show the world-show you. I'll just take you back in time! I'll turn back that clock! Back to those better days Time itself I mock! I won't accept this change not now, and not ever- I'll make you stay the same and I'll make it last forever! MWAha ha ha HA! Mwa-ha-ha-ha-
LAURIE. Jo. Wait. Stop. Stop! What is Valentino's motivation in this scene?
JO. -What?
LAURIE. We don't have a Lucella anymore. So why does he want to fight Rodrigo? Why wouldn't they just, I don't know, go play billiards? Why are we pretending it's the same?
JO. Laurie-
LAURIE. -Now that Meg's gone, perhaps you could play the lady. 
JO. Meg's coming back, she's just busy with the babies for a bit.
LAURIE. That won't change any time soon, Jo.
JO. ...I'm Rodrigo.
LAURIE. -I need a break.
JO. Beth, five minutes?
LAURIE. Why don't you want to play Lucella? She gets to drag around in costume jewelry and scream thrillingly. 
JO. You've answered your own question.
LAURIE. And you'd get to flirt with the loyal hearted Valentino.
JO. Marmee doesn't approve of flirts. 
LAURIE. Flirting is just a game men and women play. You like games!
JO. Not that kind.
LAURIE. -well-I'm glad! Some of the ladies I meet go on at such a rate that I'm embarrassed for them. Like Sally Mingott, if you had heard how she spoke to me at last week's dance! And if she knew how us men talked about her afterwards ... huh. If you could be in my place, you’d see things that would astonish you.
JO. If l could be in your place-
LAURIE. What?
JO. Why should you mock girls for doing just what you all do? Ladies can never win that game, can they?
LAURIE. Don't be thorny, Jo.
JO. But one set of rules for you, and another for me, isn't that right? Always! Always, always!
LAURIE. I only meant, SOME girls do flirt with me, you know, in life. But I prefer what you do! Don't do. I prefer you, old fellow. Just as you are. Won't you-show me some-kindness, Jo. I'm off to college tomorrow, and won't see you for months and months.
JO. I know.
LAURIE. Will you cry, watching me ride away on my white steed?
JO. I'll be burning up with jealousy, wishing I could play your role. But I might as well wish for the moon. Instead, I'll wither away in Aunt March’s service, clinging to her phantom promises of Europe 'til I turn gray.
LAURIE. Tell me what I can do- to make you happy? 
JO. Just do your best at school. Since I can't.
LAURIE. I’ll make something of myself, for you. But promise me something in return. Promise that you won't just mope around, snuffling. Promise me that you'll finally finish that novel you've been scribbling away at for years, and send it out in the world.
JO. -oh, Laurie, I don't know if it's ready to go in the world-
LAURIE. We'll both get what we wish for, if we only try. And if you send out that whopping novel- I'll give you what you've always wanted.
JO. Boot lacings.
LAURIE. Jo ... I will take you to Europe.
JO. Laurie! 
LAURIE. We'll go together! If Aunt March doesn't take you first…
JO. Really?!!!
LAURIE. I have the money! We'll have an adventure, you and me- just as long as we stay true to each other. Do you promise? 
JO. Go and make yourself useful out there, since you are now grown too tall to be ornamental! I will miss you so much.
LAURIE. Damn it, Jo! We're too old for that anymore!
AMY. Laurie! Beth said that you need a Lucella?! I'll play with you. 
LAURIE. We're done. For now. Swear you'll see me off tomorrow, Jo?
JO. As I am a gentleman. Amy, we could still rehearse. You could be Lucella-if you promise to take it seriously, and memorize your lines properly, and-
AMY. -For whom will we be doing this play? Marmee? Father?
JO. I- 
AMY. They have grandchildren to amuse them, now.
BETH. Amy-
AMY. Nobody needs this anymore, Josephine. Nobody wants it. This kind of thing is inappropriate for women of your age. I'm doing you a favor by telling you. Did I hear you say you'll see Laurie off tomorrow?
JO. Yes.
AMY. Well, you can't. You promised to call on Aunt March with me.
JO. I spend enough time bowing and scraping to Aunt March in my working hours!
AMY. Poor people are well advised to please rich ones.
JO. So we are to waste all our days pandering to millionaires, just because they have money?
AMY. Money that we need. You pretend it's such a hardship, sitting with Aunt March, but she's paid you for it!
BETH. Amy… 
JO. You have no idea what it's like! You have no idea how terrible it is to-spend years pretending to be someone you're not
AMY. -Maybe it's time to be realistic, Josephine, about your prospects. Give up childish-and, frankly, egocentric-fantasies about Showing Them All and setting the world on fire-and you'll resent people less. It's not everyone else's fault that you don't feel like you're living up to your potential.
BETH. Amy!
AMY. Just bite your tongue and humor poor old Aunt March! You don't have to agree to be agreeable.
JO. ... what about Laurie… 
AMY. He'll be better off without you… -Jo- tomorrow- I trust that you will wear something -appropriate.
BETH. Jo- 


Scene 2
AUNT MARCH. What a ... remarkable outfit, Josyphine.
JO. Thank you, Aunt March. I so agree.
AUNT MARCH. Read to us.
PARROT. Squawk! 
JO. I'm not here to work, Auntie, this is a social call-
AUNT MARCH. Fordyce's Sermons. 
JO. Sermon One: A Lady Knows Her Place.
PARROT. Knows her place-knows her place.
AUNT MARCH. You look well, Amy.
PARROT. SQUAAAAAWK.
JO. ''A lady prizes presentation:'
AMY. Why, thank you, Auntie -so do you!
PARROT. So do you, so do you!
JO. "A lady speaks with discretion… 
AMY. And Polly is so charming-
AUNT MARCH. Mind your fingers. 
JO. "A lady behaves cautiously"
AMY. Ahaha. Charming.
PARROT. Charrrmiiiiiing.
AUNT MARCH. How does your father fare, child?
AMY. A little better, Aunt March.
AUNT MARCH. Better! Not for long, I'm sure.
PARROT. Not for long, not for long- 
JO. "A lady holds her tongue:'
AUNT MARCH. He ought never to have gone to the war! But then, we should never have had a war at all.
AMY. Oh, Aunt-
AUNT MARCH. Why should we poke our noses down South? Lincoln ought never to have pressed his agenda!
AMY. Now, Auntie-
JO. ''A lady holds her tongue:'
AUNT MARCH. We ought to focus on the Union-and put the homeland first!
PARROT. Homeland first, homeland first!
AMY. Let's not talk politics-
AUNT MARCH. But your parents are both the same-your father and his radical abolitionism-
JO. ''A LADY HOLDS HER TONGUE"
AUNT MARCH. And your mother, and her immigrant trash! I told her, I said, you go amongst that filthy boat rabble-
PARROT. Boat rabble, boat rabble-
AUNT MARCH. -you never know what will come trailing home after you! And look what happened! She never listened to sage advice from cooler heads, she always wished to slum around amongst the lesser classes-and so she nearly killed your half-wit sister!
PARROT. Half-wit, half-w-
AUNT MARCH. Josyphine. What on earth!
AMY. JO! Just. Be. Agreeable.
AUNT MARCH. Josyphine?
JO. You're right! You're so right, Aunt March! You're so right, Amy! We never should have gotten into the war! Who cares if people are being enslaved? That's hundreds of miles away, why should it bother us?! Why should we take any action?!!
AMY. Josephine-
JO. Who cares if families are starving in the tenements?! That's right in our backyards, but why should we lift a finger?! No, no, I think we should sit on our hands and shut our mouths, lest we disturb others! Civility at all costs, that's what I say! Civility before humanity!
AMY. Jo-
JO. We should have no objections, isn't that it, Amy, no egocentric aspirations to change the world! We should be adults! And the adult thing is to do nothing and say nothing-and if we accomplish nothing, then that's for the best! We should just stay at home, and close our eyes, and accept the SAME EVILS, FOREVER!
AMY. JOSEPHINE. You've made your point. You may be quiet now!
PARROT. Quiet now. Quiet ... noWWWW.w..
JO. Christopher Columbus!
AUNT MARCH. What a speech, Josyphine. But I am glad to know your true thoughts, at last.
AMY. Auntie-
AUNT MARCH. Miss Amy, I have long planned to make an European tour-
JO. "Long-planned" indeed-
AUNT MARCH. And since Josyphine is so cross-patched against leaving home-or keeping a civil tongue in her head- I wondered if you might like to be my lady companion?
JO. Aunt-Auntie, you've been promising me this for YEARS
AUNTMARCH. DON'T YOU YELL, JOSYPHINE
JO. AFTER ALL THIS TIME, AFTER ALL OF THIS WORK
AUNT MARCH. I promised to bring a lady companion! A lady.
PARROT. Laaaadyyyy.
JO. Amy-
AMY. Yes. Yes, please, Aunt March! And thank you.
PARROT: SQUAWK 


Scene 3
JO. AAAAAAAAAAAA Marmee!
MARMEE. There's nothing to be done, Jo . Aunt chooses Amy.
JO. Amy's too young!
AMY. I'M NOT, I'm a woman grown. And it's your own fault! If you hadn't been so nasty and intemperate and bitter-
JO. Bitter-from years of swallowing bile!
MARMEE. Girls-please, you'll wake your father-
AMY. You think I'm stupid, Josephine, but I know more about the world than you ever did! You think that if you go to Europe, things will be so different: that you'll get to do and be whatever you want. But Europe isn't the set of one of your theatricals! You don't get to make up what happens in life! There are rules over there, just like here! Aunt March is taking me along because I'm smart enough to keep my peace! Because I act like a lady and you never do!
JO. Don't you understand, Amy?! I would make a dreadful lady, even if I tried, even if I wanted to be one! Look, they would all say, look at that awkward boy in the dress, strangling on every thought, biting his tongue 'til it fell off! I can't ever be someone like you, so I might as well be what I am!
AMY. So be what you are, Josephine. And live with the consequences.
JO. It's always so. Amy gets just what she wants, and I get all the drudgery.
MARMEE. I don't think Amy always gets what she wants.
BETH. I'm glad you're not going yet, Jo- for I should miss you.
JO. I never shall go at all. I work and push and try and because I'm not exactly what people want me to be, it all gets thrown away.
MARMEE. You wouldn't enjoy the trip as Aunt March's hand- maiden, anyhow. Amy has no grand ambitions, and little else to amuse her now that she's growing up. At least you still have your writing!
JO. Marmee, I meant what I said to Amy- I never shall be a lady- I never will be a woman like you. 
MARMEE. Jo- -you don't have to be. 
BETH. Jo-
JO. I'll show Amy! I'll go to Europe and I won't have to bow and scrape and sacrifice every part of me to get ahead. I can d o it my own way.
BETH. How?
JO.. M' y novel! I promised Laurie, and he promised me. I have to write!
BETH. Jo-
JO. I have to write!


Scene 4
JO. I said, I have to- Meg!
MEG. Hello, Jo.
JO. Meg! It's been months since you've visited- what are you doing here? 
MEG. The stage is still set up, I see. 
JO. I knew you’d be back! 
MEG · Am I too late for rehearsal?
JO. Meg. Are the babies all right?
MEG. What?
JO. ls-that-is that blood?
MEG. It's-it's jam.
JO. Jam!
MEG. Blood, Jo, you've been writing too many stories. Don’t be so dramatic! 
JO. -why are you crying? 
MEG. Where is Marmee-
JO. She's changing Papa's bandages.
MEG. I'll come back another time
JO. You could talk to me-
MEG. I need a grown woman's perspective.
JO. I-well-I'm here, Meg.
MEG. I can't say, it's too shameful.
JO. Try. 
MEG. Well- I'm home with the babies all day, you know, and Demi is starting to crawl. I can’t leave him alone for a moment but I find him headed toward the fire-
JO. Yes- 
MEG. And Daisy has the colic, she won’t stop crying, and they’re both teething- 
JO. Yes- 
MEG. And I never realized what an angel Hanna is here, with all the chores, they just  never end- and we can't afford any help, John works hard enough just to keep a roof over our head- I’m so tired of being poor- its no fun at all being mistress of the house, really. So I'm home alone with the twins, Jo- alone all day. And all day of every day I'm fighting- I'm fighting a battle against all the nappies and bottles and swaddling clothes in the world, and I’m always losing.
JO. Oh, Meg-
MEG. But today-today! They finally took a nap at the same time and it was so quiet and I sat and thought, what ifI could have anything I wished in the world right now? And I thought, I want-all I want-is-JAM.
JO. It's all right to- to have jam.
MEG. So I tore through our cupboards, and I found some dusty old pot of raspberry and ate it right out of the jar, Jo, like a child, and was happy for one moment. Just one little peaceful moment, just for me … And then JUST THEN like she SENSED it Daisy woke up and started wailing and that woke Demi and HE started wailing and then I should have gone and picked them up but then I just couldn't, I started wailing and that's how John found me, crying and covered with jam with the babies screaming in their nursery.
JO. Oh.
MEG. And John asked why I hadn't picked up the babies and I cried and he asked why I hadn't made dinner and I cried and he asked why I was so messy and I cried- And then he told me I was being hysterical and I said hysterical is just what men call women who bear and bear what men never could, and then finally snap!
JO. Served him right! Stuffy old Brooks!
MEG. He is, isn't he? Stiff and stuffy! Thank you! And then we had a big row and I told him if he wanted a perfect lady at all times he could just go off and find one, and I stormed out. And I just-I just wanted to come home. Real home. You know.
JO. Of course,
MEG. -I Just want to come back and be a little girl again, and not~ somebody's crying mother or somebody's jam-covered wife.
JO. Then DO that, Meg, come back and live here!
MEG. -Could the babies come too? I couldn't leave them.
JO. They could- they could sleep in the attic.
MEG. I don't think there'll be space enough. They keep growing and growing.
JO. Everything can be just as it was, Meg.
MEG .... what about John?
JO. Forget him! It never happened! Stuffy old- Brooks. 
BROOKS. Meg-I'm. I'm sorry, I've been working so hard and I was very-cruel, very-
JO. Stiff.
BROOKS. Rigid, yes-unfeeling, very-
JO. Stuffy?
BROOKS. Very stuffy. Please come home, Meg. I need you. The babies need you.
MEG. No. -Not stuffy, John.
JO. Meg-
MEG. Please forgive me, Jo, I was just being-childish.
JO. Didn't you want to talk to-
MEG. Jo. I'm the Marmee, now.
JO. O what end of a maiden's art! I have to write. 
BETH. Jo? You've been working so hard for months, won 't you come out- and talk to me-.
JO. Glory glory Hallelujah, Glory glory Hallelujah
BETH. Jo!
JO. I'm done! I'm done! If everything changes, then I'll change everything! Glory glory Hallelujah! My Truth is marching on!


Scene 5
MR DASHWOOD. Enter. ENTER. Whosat?
JO. It's Jo. Jo March.
MR DASHWOOD. Who?
JO. We met last year? You published my short story in your paper? ... "The Spell of Rodrigo"?
MR DASHWOOD. I buy a lot of stories. You bring another?
JO. -I brought something better! My very first, WORLD PREMIERE novel!
MR DASHWOOD. ... Novel?
JO. A whole work about Rodrigo. An epic! It has everything: love, tragedy, sword fights-pirates, mermaids, dragons, and, and death and birth, and-heavy themes. And it's set-all over Europe! So.
MR DASHWOOD. I'm not in the market for ladies' novels.
JO. But-you have a press downstairs, with books in the window
MR DASHWOOD. Those are works of literature. Not sentimental pieces.
JO. This is-serious. I've worked on it for years.
MR DASHWOOD. I assume you're a woman? Then this is a ladies' novel. Doesn't matter how you dress it up. Listen Miss March-there's a legitimate place for women's voices- bring me another sweet little story, it helps sell powder if I run it next to the ads.
JO. This is a whole book-
MR DASHWOOD. Fifteen for a story. Put some heaving bosoms in it.
JO. Fifteen? Last time you paid me thirty.
MR DASHWOOD. Meow. Seems to me that last time, you had a cooler head negotiating for you. Where's your "agent"? Some gentlemen won't pay a lady at all-but I'm forward-thinking. Miss March-a little advice: Next time you step into this world you bring that "agent" -or your father- or your husband. Remember-I'm one of the good ones.
BETH. How did it go?
JO. They didn't want me-it.
BETH. Are you all right?
JO. I was just being-childish.
BETH. Do you want to ... do you want to write? Will that make you feel better?
JO. My stories are lightweight, sentimental-they don't MEAN anything-
BETH. Oh Jo. Maybe if you tried-writing something real, something from your life-
JO. My life is-it's-nobody wants to read about that, about a house full of stupid naive little girls, about someone like me, someone awkward and deluded and not a real-a real woman, or
BETH. That's not true-
JO. It is, and wishing it was different won't change anything!
BETH. Do you want to put on a play, or-
JO. I'm too old for all that now.
BETH. Will you tell me a story? A real-
JO. Beth. STOP.
BETH. Can anything make you feel better, Jo?
JO. No.
BETH. Not anything?


Scene 6
JO. Laurie!
LAURIE. Miss March- Mr. Laurence, from next door, you may remember from our misbegotten youth-
JO. Stop that! ·
LAURIE. No-! How do I look, Jo? Like a Real College Man?
JO. You look- like a man. Wait- -have you kept your promise.
LAURIE. Studied myself to a skeleton all semester, and got top marks. With honors.
JO. Oh, Laurie!
LAURIE. I was motivated.
JO. I'm so proud of you!
LAURIE. I've been a good bo -a good man?
JO. Good old fellow.
LAURIE. -How have you been, old fellow?
JO. One trouble comes on top of another.
LAURIE. Come, what's the matter? -you know I can't bear a damsel in distress-!
JO. -I can't say, it's too shameful.
LAURIE. Couldn't you finish your novel?
JO. I did finish-it's right here, you see-
LAURIE. Three cheers for the great authoress! Huzzah, huzz
JO. Don't! I took it to the publisher and he was-dreadful, and I've been working so hard, for so long. And Amy's going to Europe because she's a lady and Meg's gone forever because she's a mother and I- I'm not anything-
LAURIE. Whoa, whoa, Jo-
JO. -there's no place for me in this world and everything's changing and everyone's growing up and away, and I don't know what to do!
LAURIE. Hold on to me. So you don't have a publisher yet -but you'll find one-or, or something! You've just got to keep trying!
JO. But if I don't get something published, Laurie, I'll never be one of the great minds. I'll just be a nobody, wasting my time serving old rich people like Aunt March, with no money and no importance, until the day I die and am forgotten.
LAURIE. Since when are you so grim?
JO. Since you went away.
LAURIE. Well. You don't-you don't have to make money, you know.
JO. Of course I do.
LAURIE. Perhaps someone could just ... give it to you.
JO. Ha!
LAURIE. Don't laugh. A sort of a knight, maybe, like brave Valentino-
JO. -that's just a story, I should know, I'm the one who made it up
LAURIE. A friend, then. Somebody who loves you.
JO. Laurie-
LAURIE. -I've loved you ever since I first saw you. Jo ... won't you? It's perfect, you must admit that- I'm one of the family already! And I have money, so you'll never have to work again! I told you I would take you to Europe-it'll be our honeymoon!
JO.  ... So Amy is a lady, and Meg is a mother-and I’d be a wife?
LAURIE. I don't want to change you, Jo! I want you to be you, and me to be me, and us to be together.
JO. Can't we just- stay as we are?
LAURIE. I can't pretend that we're still only-little children, playfellows. I need something more. Don't you?
JO .... not that. Oh, please don't cry-
LAURIE. I know it's not manful
JO. Please, it's not that, I swear!
LAURIE. Don't you love me even a little, Jo?
JO. Not a little, Laurie, so much. But not as you want me to. It's just it's not me.
LAURIE. Well. I'm not going back to college now.
JO. What?
LAURIE. I was only there for you!
JO. Laurie, you'll get over this after a while, and find some girl who will adore you and be a lady for your fine house. Me-you’d grow ashamed of me by and by, and you’d come to hate my writing, and we would be unhappy!
LAURIE. That's not (true)-
JO. You've just built up _something-in your head-you're playing a part, some idea of being a Man that you picked up from your friends or college or the world. It's not me- but it's not even you! WE can go right back to who- what- we were. All you have to do ss shake off this- childish fantasy, and-
LAURIE. -It's not childish, Jo. It's called growing up. It's real. And we can never go back. Why can't you want what any other woman would want?
JO. Because I'm not- I'm not like other women. I thought you understood.
LAURIE. I hope you get what you DO want, Jo. Whatever that is.
JO. Laurie!
AMY. Laurie! Welcome home!!!
LAURIE. Not "home:' Not now.
JO. Laurie-!
AMY. What was that about?
JO. Nothing. Why are you so dressed up?
AMY. No reason. What did you do to Laurie?!
JO. Leave me ALONE, Amy!
BETH. Jo.
JO. I'll never get out of here, Beth. I'll never get what I need. I'm never going to Europe, or- or anywhere-
BETH. What happened?
JO. Laurie made an offer to me
AMY. He what-
JO. And I had to refuse him
AMY. You what?
JO. I've lost my best friend, and everything's ruined forever.
BETH. Oh, Jo, nothing is forever.
AMY. How could you be so stupid?!
JO. What?!!
BETH. Amy-!
AMY. You always just do whatever you want-
JO. I NEVER get to do what I want-
AMY. -and make your own way and don't care how it affects anyone else- it's so senseless and rude and blind-
BETH. Amy!
AMY. You are- Josephine, you are absolutely purist!
JO. Purist?
AMY. Childish! Silly!
JO. Puerile?
AMY. I- yes, fine, but purist, too! So- unyielding, and selfish, and Josephine, don't you dare write that down. Don’t! I'm warning you!
JO. Why stop now. "Purist:'
AMY. You are impossible. You can't be the way you are!
JO. And yet.
BETH. Let's go talk to Marmee.


Scene 7
LAURIE. Enter. ENTER! Oh.
BETH. Can't you play something gayer, Laurie?
LAURIE. No.  You can tell Jo-I won't bother your family anymore.
BETH. You're family.
LAURIE. -I'm going away, Beth.
BETH. Where?
LAURIE. Not back to college!
BETH. Maybe to Europe? Amy's going, you know, with Aunt March. I'm sure Amy would love a visit to Italy. Or a- a companion.
LAURIE. -Amy is just a little girl.
BETH. Not anymore. You must see that. And she's-she's fond of you.  -I came here once to talk to your grandfather, about-changing his mind-it was hard-but then things got better, for all of us.
LAURIE. Everything's ruined forever for me now.
BETH. Nothing lasts forever. Laurie? I think-sometimes- we want so badly-we don't see what
We- we have.


Scene 8
MARMEE. Escape into writing for a while, Jo. Who knows what will come of it in the end? I should check on Papa.
JO. Has anybody seen my book?
MARMEE. Perhaps it's under here-
JO. Amy, do you have it?
AMY. I. .. do not.
JO. Maybe it's in the other room
AMY. I warned you.
JO. What?
AMY. You've been torturing me for years- writing down every word I misspoke, making me feel stupid- rampaging through life with your rough ways, never caring if you hurt Laurie or me or anybody! But you'll have nothing to show for it now, for it's gone.
JO. What?!
AMY. If you're looking for your notebook, Josephine- There you shall find your lesson at last.
JO. This notebook?
AMY. What-?
JO. This is the book I write your malapropisms in.
MARMEE. -What did you burn, Amy?
JO. Not the-the red book here? No no no no nononono- 
BETH. Jo- not your novel?
MARMEE. Jo, no, you'll burn yourself-
BETH. Was it her novel?
MARMEE. Amy, what have you done
BETH. That was her only copy, Amy!
AMY. - I thought it was the notebook, they looked the same
MARMEE. Jo, stop! Please-stop.
AMY. Josephine-
MARMEE. JO!
JO. MY ONLY COPY!
MARMEE. That's no excuse for violence-
JO. YEARS of work! All my stories, my childhood- gone!
AMY. It was an accident!
JO. I can never do it again!
AMY. I didn't mean to!
JO. Jealous, you did it because you're jealous
BETH. Jo!
AMY. I, jealous! Of an old monster like you!
MARMEE. Amy!
AMY. You great ugly boy, I shouldn't be surprised you'd treat a lady so-
MARMEE. AMY!
AMY. It serves you right!
BETH. Jo, no-!
AMY. I've done you a favor, Josephine, getting rid of that rubbish.Now you can FINALLY accept reality!
JO. I never shall forgive you. Never.
BETH. Jo-
JO. You and I, it's over.
MARMEE. -Perhaps we should retire until dinner.
JO. I can't eat at the same table as her, Marmee.
AMY. Marmee- I don't feel safe.
JO. You shouldn't feel safe! You're not.
MARMEE. Maybe-you would like to visit Meg for a few days, dear.
AMY. Why shouldn't she go?! Why am I always sent away?!
MARMEE.  Amy.
AMY. She always gets what she wants. But it doesn't matter. I'll go to Meg's- and soon I shall go to Europe with Aunt March. And there-there I imagine I'll meet somebody wonderful and get married, and then we never shall be under the same roof again! Me and my failure sister!
MARMEE. AMY. Let's go pack some things.
JO. You're not my sister.
MARMEE. Jo.
JO. Leave me alone.
BETH. Oh, Jo.
JO. -Amy's right. It's been years, and we've never had peace. We're too different. We should give up, and go our separate ways.
BETH. But we're family.
JO. Why should people be forced together when they want nothing in common? Amy will go to Europe, then to some gentleman. I'll stay here- always- and get older, angrier; more and more bitter. Let us grow apart: It's healthier for everyone involved.
BETH. I can't believe that's right.
JO. People change-they move on and away. The bonds- the- the dreams- we start out with- are- childish. They don't mean anything now.
BETH. Jo.
JO. I'm tired of fighting- everything. Breaking myself against every wall. I'm done. Let the war be over.
BETH .... stop.


Scene 9
JO. Good morning!
BETH. -was the doctor here?
JO. Marmee is talking to him now. How long have you been feeling sick again?
BETH. I never really felt well, after the fever. And I know- I know I'll never get better.
JO. Don't say that!
BETH. What did the doctor say?
JO. Hang the doctor!
BETH. So- I was right.
JO. Please don't- please- it'll be-
BETH. I'm just- I'm ashamed I've done so little.
JO. Beth-
BETH. I'm not like the rest of you. I never made plans about what I’d do when I grew up; thought of being married, or moving on-I couldn’t imagine myself anything but stupid Beth, sitting at home.
JO. You're not (stupid)-
BETH. -But I never wanted to go away! I'm afraid of being homesick, Jo. And I worry about all of you, without me.
JO. Don't worry. I'll take care of everyone-just as you do.
BETH. What?
JO. It's all right! I've decided to give up on my fantasies about riding out and changing the world.  Running away to Europe. I'll stay at home, and be everything to Father and Marmee. I'll give up writing, and make the house cheerful. I'll do my duty.
BETH. What?
JO. Beth- I have finally grown up.
BETH. WHAT?!
JO. Beth-!
BETH. How can you say that?!!
JO. I- I have no heart for writing anymore- and- I thought you'd be pleased!
BETH. That's not growing up! That's giving up!
JO. Please calm down?
BETH. So you'd play the new Beth to them, Jo? That's not the part for you! You get the privilege of growing up, so use it! Don't waste your life trying to be a violet if you're- a- chestnut burr, prickly on the outside and soft inside, or a- a big rigid oak tree, or a stupid ROCK, even-or whatever you find out that you are, Jo. I don't want that!
JO. Beth. I've never seen you angry before ...
BETH. You've proven you can provoke anyone. Don't give up. Write the real stories, Jo. Write better ones. You promise me.
JO. Is there anything I can get you, Beth? 
BETH. All I want is the family I have, you bad Jo. Where is Amy?
JO. Oh- she'll visit later. With Meg, and the babies.
BETH. I know you two are different. But make amends.
JO. I don't (think)-
BETH. Bring her, and Laurie. Bring them together. Jo-tell me a story.
JO. Now?
BETH. A real one.


Scene 10
JO. Once upon a time, there was a family. And this family lived in a small house in the shadows of a big city. And outside the city was an even bigger country-
BETH. And that country went to war.
JO. To war with itself.
BETH. That was hard-
JO. Yes. But the family stayed together. Because even if the world had split apart: together, they were whole.
BETH. Nothing lasts forever-
JO. And the best of them all, the conscience of the family- was named Beth.
BETH. And when that girl died ...
JO. No, Beth. In this story, the girl never dies.
BETH. Marmee! Will you bring the flowers closer? Look at them, all together. So beautiful!
JO . ... Beth?
ENSEMBLE. Glory Glory Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah For the Union keeps us strong!
JO. This little girl helped her family, though they were imperfect. She did her work, though it was humble. She learned her lessons, though they were small. She didn't have magical powers. She never went on big adventures. And she loved her monster, instead of slaying it. Beth's story wasn't a great epic. That's why it needs to be told. In this story, the girl never dies ...
BETH. Jo. Tell it again.
